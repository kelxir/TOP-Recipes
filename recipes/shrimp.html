            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chile hot sauce</li>
            <li>2 pounds large peeled, deveined raw shrimp</li>
            <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup cornmeal</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a large deep skillet; heat over medium-high to 370 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk together eggs, milk, and hot sauce in a shallow dish; add shrimp to mixture, and toss to coat. Whisk together flour, cornmeal, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a separate shallow dish.</li>
            <li>Remove 6 to 8 shrimp from egg mixture, shaking excess off; dredge in flour mixture. Place dredged shrimp in hot oil; fry until coating is golden and crisp, about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Repeat with remaining shrimp, bringing oil back to 370 degrees F(185 degrees C) over medium-high heat before adding each batch of shrimp.</li>
